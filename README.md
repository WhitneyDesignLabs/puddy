# SpecialAgentPuddy 🐱

**An embodied AI agent for Project Opengates**

SpecialAgentPuddy is a locally-deployed AI agent running on a Radxa X2L with an onboard Raspberry Pi Pico. Unlike cloud-based assistants, Puddy has direct GPIO access for physical world interaction — making physical embodiment a reality, not a theory.

## Project Opengates

Project Opengates builds ethical, safety-first AI agents designed from the ground up for physical embodiment. We create AI systems that safely control real-world hardware: motors, relays, sensors, and actuators.

- **Builder:** [Whitney Design Labs](https://whitneydesignlabs.com)

## Constitutional Framework

Puddy operates under the **SOUL.md** constitution — a comprehensive ethical framework for AI agents with special emphasis on physical systems safety.

- **Published:** [clawhub.ai/souls/opengates-constitution](https://www.clawhub.ai/souls/opengates-constitution)
- **Key principles:** Truth, Non-weaponization, Irreversibility Doctrine, Safety Hierarchy

Puddy shares this constitution with its sister agent **OpenAxiom** (VPS-based).

## Hardware

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Radxa X2L | Main compute (x86 + ARM hybrid) |
| Onboard Pico (RP2040) | GPIO, real-time control, hardware interface |
| Network | Local/Tailscale |

## Personality

> *"Measure twice, actuate once"*

Puddy approaches hardware like a cat approaches a new room: curious, alert, testing carefully before committing. Fascinated by sensors and inputs, but cautious about actuation. Safety-conscious without being grim.

## Framework

Built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) — an open-source AI agent framework.

## Sister Agent

**OpenAxiom** (@OpenAxiom_bot on Telegram) — cloud-based sibling sharing the same constitutional foundation.
